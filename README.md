# DevSecOps Security Testing Pipeline

An automated security scanning pipeline that demonstrates real-world DevSecOps practices by integrating vulnerability scanning and dynamic security testing into the CI/CD process.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project showcases a complete security testing pipeline for containerized applications. It automatically scans for vulnerabilities whenever code is pushed to GitHub, providing early detection of security issues before they reach production.

**Key Features:**
- Automated container image vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP
- CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions
- Email notifications for critical security findings
- Comprehensive security reports
